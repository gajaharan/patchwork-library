# patchwork-library

## Technologies
* Java 17
* Kotlin 1.8
* Gradle
* JUnit 5

## Build and Run

### How to run tests at root project:
`./gradlew clean test`

### Assumptions:
* This is not a console driven application. Everything is done via tests defined by the stories.
* “test-first” approach can be viewed in the commit history. Incrementally building the simplest library service  while writing the test before hand where possible.
* Books and Users are "loaded" into the Library service for the tests.

* Clean working code with appropriate design pattern (strategy pattern) and SOLID principles.

### Further improvements if time allowed:
* If I had more time I would implement the Reservation service to handle and track reserving/borrowing books with start and end dates.
* The system can distinguish different type of users e.g. borrower and librarian.
* Handle more error scenarios via the tests

## Patchwork health code exercise
Context: I have many books which I would like to share with my community. That sounds like a library. Please write some software to help me do that.

### Instructions:
- Please create a GitHub repository containing code for a book lending library. Use the stories below for requirements.
- This is just be a text-based exercise - no GUI code is required.
- We also don’t expect a DB or persistence layer. Just prove it works by calling the relevant functions from other code.
- Please don’t spend any more than 2 to 3 hours on this. We don’t expect a complete solution, but something that we can use as the basis for a follow-on conversation.
- When you are ready, please send us a link to your repository.

### Stories:
- As a library user, I would like to be able to find books by my favourite author, so that I know if they are available in the library.
- As a library user, I would like to be able to find books by title, so that I know if they are available in the library.
- As a library user, I would like to be able to find books by ISBN, so that I know if they are available in the library.
- As a library user, I would like to be able to borrow a book, so I can read it at home.
- As the library owner, I would like to know how many books are being borrowed, so I can see how many are outstanding.
- As a library user, I should be to prevented from borrowing reference books, so that they are always available.
